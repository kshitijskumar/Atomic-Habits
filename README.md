## Theme:
Mental Health and Awareness

## Problem statement:
With an increase in technology and hence competition, people toil day and night and ignore their mental wellness in the way. Also, the recent events of the pandemic have taken a great toll on the mental health of a person. People has lost their motivation to learn something, do something fun and utilise this time, which is affecting their physical health and mental health as well.

## What we propose:
Our project "Atomic Habits", aims at providing a way for users to engage in refreshing activities and divert from mind-numbing issues. Atomic Habits, as the name suggests, means working at a very fundamental level. As an atom is the base of any matter in the world the same way, small and basic habits or tasks can help the greater issue, "Mental Wellness." Everyone is aware of Snapchat and the streaks within it. People often tend to send blank snaps to maintain the streak and increase the snap score. Here at Atomic Habits, a person is assigned a new task daily, and as a result, the person has to upload a photo of the completed or at least the attempted task. Also, everyone loves incentives, so to keep the user engaged, there is an added streak functionality. For every day you post a picture, the Atomic Streak increases, and the day you miss, it resets to 0. The feed page will display posts of all the users doing the same activity, sharing their experiences.
